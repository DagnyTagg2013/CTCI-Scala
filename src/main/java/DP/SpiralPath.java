/**
 * Created on 11/16/16
 *
 * PROBLEM:
 * - find spiralling path from CORNER of grid into center
 *
 * ALGO:
 *
 * - TOP LHS is coordinate (0,0), moving DOWN TO RIGHT for X and Y directions!
 * - INDEX 0 to (MAX-LEN - 1)
 *
 * - CURRENT ASSUMPTIONS:  current point, current direction
 * - BOUNDARIES TO CHANGE ASSUMPTIONS:  grid boundaries, already-visited points
 *
 * - ADAPTIVE, AGILE approach
 *
 * - CHAIN RESULTs of one directional check into the INPUT for the NEXT iterative check!
 *
 * - CASE 1:  move (ONE) SPOT in current Direction
 *            - throw EXCEPTION if BOUNDARIES HIT
 *            - return UPDATED current state-changed otherwise
 *
 * - CASE 2:  move (MULTIPLE) SPOTs based on Case 1
 *            - WHILE loop, breaks on EXCEPTION, and returns PRIOR KNOWN UPDATED current state!
 *
 * - CASE 3:  change Direction based in BOUNDARIES HIT from CASE 2
 *
 * - CASE 4:  (MULTIPLE) move along line, then change direction
 *            - WHILE loop, ENDs on testing visited is COMPLETED
 *            - each STEP is DIRECTION change DECISION-POINT!
 *
 * - CONCLUSION:
 *            - use VISITED to CACHE results and SAVE on redundant computations
 *            - factor out ACTION vs DECISION boundaries
 *            - encapsulate with progessive LOOPs for readability and minimizing complexity of a recursive call!
 *            - use EXCEPTIONs to BREAK out of loops on BOUNDARY conditions, but retain PRIOR state on STACK!
 *            - each function is to progress from VALID current state to NEXT state (which maybe invalid)
 *            - pass data on STACK instead of state variables on class instance!
